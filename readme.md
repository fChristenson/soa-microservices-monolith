# SOA vs MicroServices vs Monolith

## What we will cover

- What is SOA?
- What is a MicroService?
- What is a Monolith?
- When does one make sense over the other?

# Notes

When we talk about application architecture the main 3 are usually SOA, MicroServices and Monolithic applications.

Each of these have a use case and it is important to understand when one makes more sense than another.
